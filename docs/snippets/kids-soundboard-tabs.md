=== "GAIN"
    This is the white dial at the top immediately below the input jacks

    *   How sensitive do you want the microphone / source to be?
    *   **Start at the middle 'U' symbol / 12 o'clock** to be safe


===  "LOW CUT"
    This is the grey rectangular button under the GAIN dial.

    *   Pressing this IN applies a high-pass filter/low-cut at 100Hz. 
    *   This is typically **applied on vocal mics** to remove the boominess and the low-end of air pops (Imagine saying "B-u-BB-le gum")

=== "EQ"
    There are three blue dials labeled LOW/MID/HI. **Start them all in the middle / at 12 o'clock.**

    *   **LOW (80Hz)**: Determines boominess/warmth. 
        *   Is the kick/bass line from Forrest Frank's song making its way out to the lobby? Let's turn this DOWN a few notches.
        *   Playing lounge music but the room feels dead? Turning this UP might help with the vibes of the room.
    *   **MID (2.5kHz)**: Determines clarity/harshness.
        *   Does the music/someone's voice sound harsh/piercing to the ears? Let's turn this DOWN.
        *   Is the MC eating the mic and sound muffled/boxy? Are you finding it hard to make out the lyrics of a song? Try turning this UP.
    *   **HI (12kHz)**: Determines brightness/airyness. 
        *   Do the "essS" sounds (aka "sibilance") pierce your eardrums? Do the cymbals sound overly harsh or "hissy"? Let's turn this DOWN.
        *   Turning this UP can add some air/"sparkle" to vocals and instruments. 

=== "MON" 
    This is the green dial under the EQ dials

    *   Set output volume to the MONITOR mix. This is commonly used to create a custom mix to go into the monitor wedge so musicians can hear themselves. 
    *   **You can IGNORE this for Sundays**

=== "FX" 
    This is the yellow dial

    *   This dial determines how much of the effect you want to add. 
    *   **For Sundays, make sure it's set to ZERO (turn counter-clockwise to 8 o'clock)**
    *   For live worship sets, you can add a bit to vocals for reverb for added ambiance/clarity.

=== "PAN/BAL"
    This is the grey dial above the fader

    *   This dial determines whether you want the audio to lean to the left or right. 
    *   ALWAYS set this to the MIDDLE (12 o'clock) for all channels unless instructed otherwise.

=== "MUTE"
    This is a large grey button immediately above the fader.

    *   Press this button IN will silence the specific channel. 
    *   The red LED is supposed to light up, but is probably broken on our board. 
    *   **PLEASE physically make sure this is unpressed on the channels you want**
